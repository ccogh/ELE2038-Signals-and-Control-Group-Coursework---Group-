## How to run Simulator

Download Electrical, Mechanics and Sensor Python files.
Place in a folder named: "Model" alongside an empty file named: "__init__.py"
(This allows the folder to be ran as a package.)

Install dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, etc.)

In Terminal, run the command:
cd /XXX/XXX/XX/ELE2038_control (Where your folder is saved)

Then execute:
python3 -m ele2038.sim.run_open_loop
